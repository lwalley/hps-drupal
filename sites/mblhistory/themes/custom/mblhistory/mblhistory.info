base theme  = hpszen

; Don't override basic.css inherited from hpszen theme, because it contains
; normalisation and a basic layout relevant to the HPS distribution. Instead,
; to alter layout select different panels layouts in page manager, and to
; customise components add new modular, theme and state stylesheets.
; @see http://smacss.com/book/categorizing
stylesheets[all][] = css/modules.css

; Don't override script.js inherited from hpszen theme because it contains
; useful generic behaviour applicable to the HPS distribution. Instead, you
; can alter hpszen behaviours, or add new behaviours by adding new js files.
; If you really need to override the hpszen script.js file then uncomment the
; js/scripts.js line (use and empty script.js file to 'disable' hpszen js).

; Sub-themes do not inherit regions so we define them here.
; @see http://drupal.org/node/225125
; This section lists the regions defined in HPS Zen's default page.tpl.php and
; maintenance-page.tpl.php files.
regions[header]         = Header
regions[navigation]     = Navigation bar
regions[highlighted]    = Highlighted
regions[help]           = Help
regions[content]        = Content
regions[bottom]         = Bottom
regions[footer]         = Footer

; The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
; show up on the blocks administration page. But they are required in order for
; the html.tpl.php to work properly, so do not delete them.

regions[page_top]       = Page top
regions[page_bottom]    = Page bottom



; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
; admin/appearance config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
; for elements not used by your sub-theme. To suppress a check box, omit the
; entry for it below. See the Drupal 7 Theme Guide for more info:
